# DDQN-PER-CarRacingV2

This is an implementation of Double Deep Q-Learning with Prioritized Experience Replay to solve OpenAI Gymnasyum CarRacing-v2 environment. 

```agent.py``` contains the whole implementations of all the class needed; 

```main.py``` contains a controller for training, rendering and evaluation;

The whole implementation has been done in Torch framework and the training has been done on a GPU accelerator.
